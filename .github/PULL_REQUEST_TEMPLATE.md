<!--
Context Is The Work. The diff shows WHAT changed; this body carries WHAT we meant,
WHAT constrained us, and HOW we know it's correct. Optimize for 3 reader modes:
30s intent → 3–7min reviewer guidance → deep-dive provenance. Don't paste the agent
transcript — serialize the plot points. See README.md and the relevant docs/ pages.
-->

## Goal

<!-- The outcome we're producing — not the mechanism. Why now? -->

## Non-goals

<!-- What we're explicitly NOT doing — data model? API/partner contract? refactors? -->

## Constraints / invariants

<!-- What would make this change wrong even if tests pass? Document boundaries,
Arabic rendering requirements, safety constraints, or domain vocabulary. -->

## Approach

<!-- The shape of the solution, in 2–4 lines. -->

## What changed (walkthrough)

<!-- Where should a reviewer look first? The plot points, in order. -->

## Verification

<!-- How do we KNOW this works? Commands run + outcomes. -->

- [ ] `pnpm check`
- [ ] `pnpm test:coverage`
- [ ] `pnpm db:setup` (when persistence or migrations changed)
- [ ] `pnpm smoke` (when runtime or API behavior changed)
- [ ] Arabic sanity render or other manual checks, when relevant:

## Risks & rollback

<!-- How does this fail in prod, and how do we undo it? Feature flag %? Migration? DLQ? -->
